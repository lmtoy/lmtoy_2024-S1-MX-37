this SEQ project in intermediate bands suffered from a lot of birdies. Each main birdie has two satellites, 
so the list was:

	birdies=2176,2258,2261,2264,2433,2471,2474,2477,2643,2646,2649,2687,2856,2859,2862

See the *.birdies.tab files (and bstats for the channel based stats)

PI is interested in several lines, but spread out over the band, and the actual restfreq is
none of the lines.

restfreq=87.88,95.936

87.848    NH2CHO    4(1,3)-3(1,2)
87.925    HNCO      5-4

95.91431  CH3OH     2(1,2)-1(1,1)
95.947    CH3CHO    5(0,5)-4(0,4)-E
95.963    CH3CHO    5(0,5)-4(0,4)-A
95.967    (CH3)2CO  17(17,0)-17(16,1)EE
